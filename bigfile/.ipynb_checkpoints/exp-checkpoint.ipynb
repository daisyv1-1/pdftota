Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in)\\\\n\\\\nclock[3][4][5]\\\\n\\\\nbee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common\\\\n\\\\nostrich. There are over 11,000 living species, more than\\\\n\\\\nhalf of which are passerine, or \"perching\" birds. Birds\\\\n\\\\nhave wings whose development varies according to\\\\n\\\\nspecies; the only known groups without wings are the\\\\n\\\\nextinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly,\\\\n\\\\nalthough further evolution has led to the loss of flight in\\\\n\\\\nsome birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse\\\\n\\\\nendemic island species. The digestive and respiratory\\\\n\\\\nsystems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.\\\\n\\\\nSome bird species of aquatic environments, particularly\\\\n\\\\nseabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.\\\\n\\\\nBirds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are\\\\n\\\\nconsidered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the\\\\n\\\\ncrocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive\\\\n\\\\navialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx)\\\\n\\\\nScientific classification\\\\n\\\\nwhich first appeared during the Late Jurassic.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to recent estimates, modern birds\\\\n\\\\nDomain:\\\\n\\\\nEukaryota\\\\n\\\\n(Neornithes) evolved in the Late Cretaceous and\\\\n\\\\nKingdom:\\\\n\\\\nAnimalia\\\\n\\\\ndiversified dramatically around the time of the\\\\n\\\\nPhylum:\\\\n\\\\nChordata\\\\n\\\\nCretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million\\\\n\\\\nyears ago, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-\\\\n\\\\nClade:\\\\n\\\\nSauropsida\\\\n\\\\navian dinosaurs.[7]\\\\n\\\\nClade:\\\\n\\\\nArchosauria\\\\n\\\\nMany social species pass on knowledge across\\\\n\\\\nClade:\\\\n\\\\nAvemetatarsalia\\\\n\\\\ngenerations, which is considered a form of culture.\\\\n\\\\nClade:\\\\n\\\\nDinosauria\\\\n\\\\nBirds are social, communicating with visual signals,\\\\n\\\\nClade:\\\\n\\\\nTheropoda\\\\n\\\\ncalls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as\\\\n\\\\ncooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and Clade:\\\\n\\\\nOrnithurae\\\\n\\\\nmobbing of predators.

Other species have\\\\n\\\\nExtant clades\\\\n\\\\nbreeding systems that are polygynous (one male with\\\\n\\\\nmany females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with\\\\n\\\\nPalaeognathae (ratites and tinamou)\\\\n\\\\nmany males).

They\\\\n\\\\nStruthionimorphae (ostrich)\\\\n\\\\nare usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents.\\\\n\\\\nNotopalaeognathae\\\\n\\\\nMost birds have an extended period of parental care\\\\n\\\\nafter hatching.\\\\n\\\\nNeognathae\\\\n\\\\nMany species of birds are economically important as\\\\n\\\\nPangalloanserae (fowl)\\\\n\\\\nfood for human consumption and raw material in\\\\n\\\\nNeoaves\\\\n\\\\nmanufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated\\\\n\\\\nbirds being important sources of eggs, meat, and\\\\n\\\\nSynonyms\\\\n\\\\nfeathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are\\\\n\\\\nNeornithes Gadow, 1883\\\\n\\\\npopular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested\\\\n\\\\nfor use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human\\\\n\\\\nculture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though\\\\n\\\\nefforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism\\\\n\\\\nindustry.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEvolution and classification\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby\\\\n\\\\nand John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae.[8] Carl Linnaeus\\\\n\\\\nmodified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification\\\\n\\\\nsystem currently in use. [9] Birds are categorised as the biological\\\\n\\\\nclass Aves in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the clade Theropoda. [10]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only\\\\n\\\\nliving representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the\\\\n\\\\nlate 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as\\\\n\\\\nall descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern\\\\n\\\\nbirds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. [11] However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in\\\\n\\\\nArchaeopteryx is often considered\\\\n\\\\nthe 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents\\\\n\\\\nthe oldest known true bird.\\\\n\\\\nto the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown\\\\n\\\\ngroup of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most\\\\n\\\\ngroups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the broader group Avialae,[12] on the principle that a clade based on extant species should be limited to those extant species and their closest\\\\n\\\\nextinct relatives.[12]\\\\n\\\\nGauthier and de Queiroz identified four different definitions for the same biological name \"Aves\", which is\\\\n\\\\na problem. [13] The authors proposed to reserve the term Aves only for the crown group consisting of the last\\\\n\\\\ncommon ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants, [13] which corresponds to meaning number 4\\\\n\\\\nbelow. They assigned other names to the other groups.[13]\\\\n\\\\n1. Aves can mean all archosaurs closer\\\\n\\\\nSquamates\\\\n\\\\nto birds than to crocodiles (alternately\\\\n\\\\nLizards & snakes\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAvemetatarsalia)\\\\n\\\\n2. Aves can mean those advanced\\\\n\\\\nPantestudines Turtles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\narchosaurs with feathers (alternately\\\\n\\\\nReptiles\\\\n\\\\nAvifilopluma)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCrocodiles\\\\n\\\\n3. Aves can mean those feathered\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArchosaurs\\\\n\\\\ndinosaurs that fly (alternately Avialae)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4. Aves can mean the last common\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nancestor of all the currently living birds\\\\n\\\\nThe birds\\\\\\' phylogenetic relationships to major living\\\\n\\\\nand all of its descendants (a \" crown\\\\n\\\\nreptile groups. (The turtles\\\\\\' position is uncertain: Some\\\\n\\\\ngroup\" , in this sense synonymous with\\\\n\\\\nauthorities embed them inside the Archosaurs, with birds and\\\\n\\\\nNeornithes)\\\\n\\\\ncrocodiles. )\\\\n\\\\nUnder the fourth definition Archaeopteryx,\\\\n\\\\ntraditionally considered one of the earliest members of Aves, is removed from this group, becoming a non-\\\\n\\\\navian dinosaur instead. These proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of\\\\n\\\\npalaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with the\\\\n\\\\nvernacular term \"bird\" by these researchers.

[15]\\\\n\\\\nMost researchers define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. Many authors have used a\\\\n\\\\ndefinition similar to \"all theropods closer to birds than to Deinonychus\" ,[16][17] with Troodon being sometimes added as a second external specifier in case it is closer to birds than to Deinonychus. [18] Avialae\\\\n\\\\nis also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based clade (that is, one based on physical characteristics).\\\\n\\\\nJacques Gauthier, who named Avialae in 1986, re-defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and the birds that descended from them. [13][19]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDespite being currently one of the most widely used, the crown-group definition of Aves has been criticised\\\\n\\\\nby some researchers. Lee and Spencer (1997) argued that, contrary to what Gauthier defended, this\\\\n\\\\ndefinition would not increase the stability of the clade and the exact content of Aves will always be\\\\n\\\\nuncertain because any defined clade (either crown or not) will have few synapomorphies distinguishing it\\\\n\\\\nfrom its closest relatives. Their alternative definition is synonymous to Avifilopluma.[20]\\\\n\\\\nDinosaurs and the origin of birds\\\\n\\\\n†Scansoriopterygidae\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n† Eosinopteryx\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n† Jinfengopteryx\\\\n\\\\nSimplified phylogenetic tree showing the\\\\n\\\\n† Aurornis\\\\n\\\\nrelationship between modern birds and other\\\\n\\\\nParaves\\\\n\\\\ndinosaurs[22]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n†Dromaeosauridae\\\\n\\\\nEumaniraptora\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBased on fossil and biological evidence, most\\\\n\\\\n†Troodontidae\\\\n\\\\nscientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup\\\\n\\\\nof theropod dinosaurs[23] and, more specifically,\\\\n\\\\nAvialae\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nmembers of Maniraptora, a group of theropods which\\\\n\\\\nincludes dromaeosaurids and oviraptorosaurs, among Cladogram fol owing the results of a phylogenetic\\\\n\\\\nothers. [24] As scientists have discovered more\\\\n\\\\nstudy by Cau et al. , 2015[21]\\\\n\\\\ntheropods closely related to birds, the previously clear\\\\n\\\\ndistinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. By the 2000s, discoveries in the Liaoning\\\\n\\\\nProvince of northeast China, which demonstrated many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contributed to this ambiguity. [25][26][27]\\\\n\\\\nThe consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the\\\\n\\\\nflying theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the\\\\n\\\\ndeinonychosaurs,\\\\n\\\\nwhich\\\\n\\\\ninclude\\\\n\\\\ndromaeosaurids\\\\n\\\\nand\\\\n\\\\ntroodontids. [29] Together, these form a group called Paraves. Some\\\\n\\\\nbasal members of Deinonychosauria, such as Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most\\\\n\\\\nbasal deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence raises the\\\\n\\\\npossibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal,\\\\n\\\\nhave been able to glide, or both. [30][31] Unlike Archaeopteryx and\\\\n\\\\nthe non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, studies\\\\n\\\\nsuggest that the first avialans were omnivores. [32]\\\\n\\\\nAnchiornis huxleyi is an important\\\\n\\\\nsource of information on the early\\\\n\\\\nThe Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first\\\\n\\\\nevolution of birds in the Late\\\\n\\\\ntransitional fossils to be found, and it provided support for the\\\\n\\\\nJurassic period. [28]\\\\n\\\\ntheory of evolution in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx was the\\\\n\\\\nfirst fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n—teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail—as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of\\\\n\\\\nmodern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true\\\\n\\\\nancestor.[33]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEarly evolution\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOver 40% of key traits found in modern birds evolved during the\\\\n\\\\n60 million year transition from the earliest bird-line archosaurs to\\\\n\\\\nthe first maniraptoromorphs, i.e. the first dinosaurs closer to living\\\\n\\\\nbirds than to Tyrannosaurus rex. The loss of osteoderms otherwise\\\\n\\\\ncommon in archosaurs and acquisition of primitive feathers might\\\\n\\\\nhave occurred early during this phase. [15][35] After the appearance\\\\n\\\\nConfuciusornis sanctus, a\\\\n\\\\nof Maniraptoromorpha, the next 40 million years marked a\\\\n\\\\nCretaceous bird from China that lived\\\\n\\\\ncontinuous reduction of body size and the accumulation of neotenic\\\\n\\\\n125 million years ago, is the oldest\\\\n\\\\n(juvenile-like) characteristics. Hypercarnivory became increasingly\\\\n\\\\nknown bird to have a beak. [34]\\\\n\\\\nless common while braincases enlarged and forelimbs became\\\\n\\\\nlonger.[15] The integument evolved into complex, pennaceous\\\\n\\\\nfeathers. [35]\\\\n\\\\nThe oldest known paravian (and probably the earliest avialan) fossils come from the Tiaojishan Formation\\\\n\\\\nof China, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period (Oxfordian stage), about 160 million years ago.\\\\n\\\\nThe avialan species from this time period include Anchiornis huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, and Aurornis\\\\n\\\\nxui. [14]\\\\n\\\\nThe well-known probable early avialan, Archaeopteryx, dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about\\\\n\\\\n155 million years old) from Germany. Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds but were later lost during bird evolution. These features include enlarged\\\\n\\\\nclaws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or \"hind\\\\n\\\\nwings\" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.[36]\\\\n\\\\nAvialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the Cretaceous period. Many groups retained\\\\n\\\\nprimitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves).[37] Increasingly stiff tails (especially the\\\\n\\\\noutermost half) can be seen in the evolution of maniraptoromorphs, and this process culminated in the\\\\n\\\\nappearance of the pygostyle, an ossification of fused tail vertebrae.[15] In the late Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago, the ancestors of all modern birds evolved a more open pelvis, allowing them to lay\\\\n\\\\nlarger eggs compared to body size. [38] Around 95 million years ago, they evolved a better sense of\\\\n\\\\nsmell. [39]\\\\n\\\\nA third stage of bird evolution starting with Ornithothoraces (the \"bird-chested\" avialans) can be associated with the refining of aerodynamics and flight capabilities, and the loss or co-ossification of several skeletal\\\\n\\\\nfeatures. Particularly significant are the development of an enlarged, keeled sternum and the alula, and the loss of grasping hands.

[44] Euornithes also included the first\\\\n\\\\n93 million years ago, was\\\\n\\\\navialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers, [45]\\\\n\\\\nthe first known prehistoric\\\\n\\\\nwhich may have replaced the \"hind wing\" as the primary mode of aerial\\\\n\\\\nbird relative preserved with\\\\n\\\\nmaneuverability and braking in flight.

As both species are small aerial and canopy foraging omnivores, a similar ecological niche was inferred for this hypothetical ancestor.[46]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiversification of modern birds\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMost studies agree on a Cretaceous age\\\\n\\\\nPalaeognathae (ratites and tinamous)\\\\n\\\\nfor the most recent common ancestor of\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nmodern birds but estimates range from\\\\n\\\\n(landfowl\\\\n\\\\nand\\\\n\\\\nthe Early Cretaceous[3][47] to the latest\\\\n\\\\nGal oanserae waterfowl)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCretaceous. [48][4] Similarly, there is no\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAves\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nagreement on whether most of the early\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNeognathae\\\\n\\\\n(all\\\\n\\\\nother\\\\n\\\\nbirds\\\\n\\\\ndiversification of modern birds occurred\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNeoaves\\\\n\\\\nincluding\\\\n\\\\nperching\\\\n\\\\nin the Cretaceous and associated with\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nbirds)\\\\n\\\\nbreakup\\\\n\\\\nof\\\\n\\\\nthe\\\\n\\\\nsupercontinent\\\\n\\\\nGondwana or occurred later and\\\\n\\\\nMajor groups of modern birds based on Sibley-Ahlquist\\\\n\\\\npotentially as a consequence of the\\\\n\\\\ntaxonomy\\\\n\\\\nCretaceous–Palaeogene\\\\n\\\\nextinction\\\\n\\\\nevent. [49] This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; most molecular dating studies suggests a Cretaceous evolutionary radiation, while fossil evidence points to a Cenozoic radiation (the so-called \\\\\\'rocks\\\\\\' versus \\\\\\'clocks\\\\\\' controversy).\\\\n\\\\nThe discovery of Vegavis from the Maastrichtian, the last stage of the Late Cretaceous proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the Cenozoic era. [50] The affinities of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, [51] are still too controversial to\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nprovide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification. In 2020, Asteriornis from the Maastrichtian was described, it appears to be a close relative of Galloanserae, the earliest diverging lineage within Neognathae.[1]\\\\n\\\\nAttempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence using genomic-scale DNA data and comprehensive\\\\n\\\\nfossil information have not resolved the controversy.[48][52] However, a 2015 estimate that used a new method for calibrating molecular clocks confirmed that while modern birds originated early in the Late Cretaceous, likely in Western Gondwana, a pulse of diversification in all major groups occurred around the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event.[7] Modern birds would have expanded from West Gondwana\\\\n\\\\nthrough two routes. One route was an Antarctic interchange in the Paleogene. The other route was probably\\\\n\\\\nvia Paleocene land bridges between South American and North America, which allowed for the rapid\\\\n\\\\nexpansion and diversification of Neornithes into the Holarctic and Paleotropics. [7] On the other hand, the occurrence of Asteriornis in the Northern Hemisphere suggest that Neornithes dispersed out of East\\\\n\\\\nGondwana before the Paleocene.[1]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClassification of bird orders\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAll modern birds lie within the crown group Aves (alternately Neornithes), which has two subdivisions: the\\\\n\\\\nPalaeognathae, which includes the flightless ratites (such as the ostriches) and the weak-flying tinamous,\\\\n\\\\nand the extremely diverse Neognathae, containing all other birds.[53] These two subdivisions have variously been given the rank of superorder, [54] cohort, [10] or infraclass.[55] The number of known living bird species is around 11,000[56][57] although sources may differ in their precise numbers.\\\\n\\\\nCladogram of modern bird relationships based on Stiller et al.

Sibley and Ahlquist\\\\\\'s Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark work on the subject. [60] Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of\\\\n\\\\norders is accurate, [61] but scientists disagree about the relationships among the orders themselves; evidence\\\\n\\\\nfrom modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong\\\\n\\\\nconsensus has emerged. Fossil and molecular evidence from the 2010s is providing an increasingly clear\\\\n\\\\npicture of the evolution of modern bird orders. [48][52]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenomics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs of 2010, the genome had been sequenced for only two birds, the chicken and the zebra finch. As of 2022 the genomes of 542 species of birds had been completed. At least one genome has been sequenced\\\\n\\\\nfrom every order. [62][63] These include at least one species in about 90% of extant avian families (218 out\\\\n\\\\nof 236 families recognised by the Howard and Moore Checklist).[64]\\\\n\\\\nBeing able to sequence and compare whole genomes gives researchers many types of information, about\\\\n\\\\ngenes, the DNA that regulates the genes, and their evolutionary history. This has led to reconsideration of\\\\n\\\\nsome of the classifications that were based solely on the identification of protein-coding genes. Waterbirds\\\\n\\\\nsuch as pelicans and flamingos, for example, may have in common specific adaptations suited to their environment that were developed independently. [62][63]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDistribution\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven\\\\n\\\\ncontinents, reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel\\\\\\'s\\\\n\\\\nbreeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in\\\\n\\\\nAntarctica.[66] The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions.\\\\n\\\\nIt was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher\\\\n\\\\nspeciation rates in the tropics; however studies from the 2000s\\\\n\\\\nfound higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset\\\\n\\\\nby greater extinction rates than in the tropics.[67] Many species\\\\n\\\\nThe range of the house sparrow has\\\\n\\\\nmigrate annually over great distances and across oceans; several\\\\n\\\\nexpanded dramatically due to human\\\\n\\\\nactivities. [65]\\\\n\\\\nfamilies of birds have adapted to life both on the world\\\\\\'s oceans and\\\\n\\\\nin them, and some seabird species come ashore only to breed,[68]\\\\n\\\\nwhile some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres\\\\n\\\\n(980 ft) deep. [69]\\\\n\\\\nMany bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. [70] Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity.[71] Some species, including cattle egret,[72] yellow-headed caracara[73] and galah, [74] have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural expansion created alternative habitats although modern practices of intensive agriculture have negatively impacted farmland bird populations.[75]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnatomy and physiology\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompared with other vertebrates, birds have a body\\\\n\\\\nplan that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to\\\\n\\\\nfacilitate flight.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSkeletal system\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. They\\\\n\\\\nhave large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities)\\\\n\\\\nwhich connect with the respiratory system. [76] The\\\\n\\\\nskull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial\\\\n\\\\nsutures. [77] The orbital cavities that house the eyeballs External anatomy of a bird (example: yellow-\\\\n\\\\nare large and separated from each other by a bony\\\\n\\\\nwattled lapwing): 1 Beak, 2 Head, 3 Iris, 4 Pupil, 5\\\\n\\\\nseptum (partition). The spine has cervical, thoracic, Mantle, 6 Lesser coverts, 7 Scapulars, 8 Median\\\\n\\\\nlumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical\\\\n\\\\ncoverts, 9 Tertials, 10 Rump, 11 Primaries, 12\\\\n\\\\n(neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible,\\\\n\\\\nVent, 13 Thigh, 14 Tibio-tarsal articulation, 15\\\\n\\\\nbut movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic\\\\n\\\\nTarsus, 16 Foot, 17 Tibia, 18 Belly, 19 Flanks, 20\\\\n\\\\nvertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae. [78] The last\\\\n\\\\nBreast, 21 Throat, 22 Wattle, 23 Eyestripe\\\\n\\\\nfew are fused with the pelvis to form the\\\\n\\\\nsynsacrum. [77] The ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders. The forelimbs are modified\\\\n\\\\ninto wings.[79] The wings are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups that\\\\n\\\\nlost their wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. [80]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExcretory system\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLike the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid, instead of urea or ammonia, through the ureters into the intestine.\\\\n\\\\nBirds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste.[81][82][83] However, birds such as hummingbirds can be\\\\n\\\\nfacultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. [84] They also excrete\\\\n\\\\ncreatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. [77] This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird\\\\\\'s cloaca. [85][86] The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. [87]\\\\n\\\\nIt is a common but not universal feature of altricial passerine nestlings (born helpless, under constant parental care) that instead of excreting directly into the nest, they produce a fecal sac. This is a mucus-covered pouch that allows parents to either dispose of the waste outside the nest or to recycle the waste\\\\n\\\\nthrough their own digestive system.[88]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReproductive system\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMost male birds do not have intromittent penises. [89] Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the\\\\n\\\\nkiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. [90][91] Its length is thought to be related to sperm competition[92] and it fills with lymphatic fluid instead of blood when erect.[93] When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent.\\\\n\\\\nFemale birds have sperm storage tubules[94] that allow sperm to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. [95] Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. Most female birds have a single ovary and a single oviduct, both on the left side,[96] but there are exceptions: species in at least 16 different orders of birds have two ovaries. Even these species, however, tend to have a\\\\n\\\\nsingle oviduct.[96] It has been speculated that this might be an adaptation to flight, but males have two\\\\n\\\\ntestes, and it is also observed that the gonads in both sexes decrease dramatically in size outside the\\\\n\\\\nbreeding season. [97][98] Also terrestrial birds generally have a single ovary, as does the platypus, an egg-laying mammal. A more likely explanation is that the egg develops a shell while passing through the oviduct\\\\n\\\\nover a period of about a day, so that if two eggs were to develop at the same time, there would be a risk to\\\\n\\\\nsurvival.[96] While rare, mostly abortive, parthenogenesis is not unknown in birds and eggs can be diploid,\\\\n\\\\nautomictic and results in male offspring. [99]\\\\n\\\\nBirds are solely gonochoric. [100] Meaning they have two sexes: either female or male. The sex of birds is determined by the Z and W sex chromosomes, rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in\\\\n\\\\nmammals. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z\\\\n\\\\nchromosome (WZ). [77] A complex system of disassortative mating with two morphs is involved in the\\\\n\\\\nwhite-throated sparrow Zonotrichia albicollis, where white- and tan-browed morphs of opposite sex pair, making it appear as if four sexes were involved since any individual is compatible with only a fourth of the\\\\n\\\\npopulation.[101]\\\\n\\\\nIn nearly all species of birds, an individual\\\\\\'s sex is determined at fertilisation. However, one 2007 study\\\\n\\\\nclaimed to demonstrate temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio. [102] This, however, was later proven to not be the case. These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex\\\\n\\\\ndetermination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.[103]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRespiratory and circulatory systems\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups. [77] Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the\\\\n\\\\nlungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior\\\\n\\\\nair sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird\\\\\\'s lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air\\\\n\\\\nduring both inhalation and exhalation. [104] Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the\\\\n\\\\ntrachea;[105] the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the\\\\n\\\\nperception of the bird\\\\\\'s size.[106]\\\\n\\\\nIn birds, the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the aorta. [77] The postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. Unlike in mammals, the circulating red\\\\n\\\\nblood cells in birds retain their nucleus. [107]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHeart type and features\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart\\\\n\\\\ncontained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous\\\\n\\\\nfluid for lubrication.[108] The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber\\\\n\\\\nto the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart\\\\\\'s pace is maintained by\\\\n\\\\npacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. [109]\\\\n\\\\nThe sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarising signal transduction\\\\n\\\\npathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which\\\\n\\\\nDidactic model of an\\\\n\\\\ncommunicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of\\\\n\\\\navian heart\\\\n\\\\nmuscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like\\\\n\\\\na mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and\\\\n\\\\nepicardial layers.[108] The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally\\\\n\\\\nlarger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be\\\\n\\\\npumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight. [110]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOrganisation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface\\\\n\\\\narea to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. [110] The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the\\\\n\\\\npressure of the ventricular contractions, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood\\\\n\\\\nmoves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move\\\\n\\\\naway from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area\\\\n\\\\nand slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas\\\\n\\\\nexchange can occur.[111]\\\\n\\\\nCapillaries are organised into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon\\\\n\\\\ndioxide waste. In the capillary beds, blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated, it travels through venules then veins and back to the\\\\n\\\\nheart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood\\\\n\\\\ntravels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. [111] Once the blood reaches the heart, it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be\\\\n\\\\npumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood\\\\n\\\\nthen flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body. [20]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNervous system\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe nervous system is large relative to the bird\\\\\\'s size.[77] The most developed part of the brain of birds is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the\\\\n\\\\ncerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of\\\\n\\\\nsmell[112] with notable exceptions including kiwis, [113] New World vultures[114] and tubenoses. [115] The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\naccommodation for vision in air and water. [77] Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic,\\\\n\\\\npossessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones. [116] They also have double cones, likely to mediate achromatic vision. [117]\\\\n\\\\nMany birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that\\\\n\\\\nare invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes\\\\n\\\\nappear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the\\\\n\\\\npresence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their\\\\n\\\\nfeathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective\\\\n\\\\nThe nictitating membrane as it covers the eye of a\\\\n\\\\ncrown patch which is displayed in courtship by\\\\n\\\\nmasked lapwing\\\\n\\\\nposturing and raising of their nape feathers. [118]\\\\n\\\\nUltraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have\\\\n\\\\nbeen shown to search for prey by detecting the UV\\\\n\\\\nreflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. [119] With the exception of pigeons and a few other\\\\n\\\\nspecies,[120] the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating\\\\n\\\\nmembrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally.[121] The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. [77] The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. [77]\\\\n\\\\nEyes of most birds are large, not very round and capable of only limited movement in the orbits,[77]\\\\n\\\\ntypically 10–20°. [122] Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of\\\\n\\\\nfield. [122][123] The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea,\\\\n\\\\nbut it is not spiral as in mammals.[124]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefence and intraspecific combat\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA few species are able to use chemical defences against predators; some Procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor,[125] and some species of pitohuis from New Guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers. [126]\\\\n\\\\nA lack of field observations limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result\\\\n\\\\nin injury or death.[127] The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas ( Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose ( Plectropterus), the torrent duck ( Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing ( Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks ( Tachyeres), geese and swans ( Anserinae), the solitaire ( Pezophaps), sheathbills ( Chionis), some guans ( Crax) and stone curlews ( Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents.[127] The jacanas Actophilornis and\\\\n\\\\nIrediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. Swans,\\\\n\\\\nfor instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young. [127]\\\\n\\\\nFeathers, plumage, and scales\\\\n\\\\nFeathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. [77] There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\npurposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and\\\\n\\\\narise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution\\\\n\\\\npattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and\\\\n\\\\nsystematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the\\\\n\\\\nbody, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social\\\\n\\\\nstatus,[128] and sex. [129]\\\\n\\\\nPlumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that\\\\n\\\\nhas moulted after breeding is known as the \" non-breeding\"\\\\n\\\\nThe disruptively patterned plumage\\\\n\\\\nplumage, or—in the Humphrey–Parkes terminology—\"basic\"\\\\n\\\\nof the African scops owl allows it to\\\\n\\\\nplumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are\\\\n\\\\nblend in with its surroundings.\\\\n\\\\nknown under the Humphrey–Parkes system as \" alternate\"\\\\n\\\\nplumages. [130] Moulting is annual in most species, although some\\\\n\\\\nmay have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting\\\\n\\\\npatterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost\\\\n\\\\nprimary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.[131]\\\\n\\\\nA small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily\\\\n\\\\nbecoming flightless.[132] As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the\\\\n\\\\ninnermost pair.[131] Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. [133] The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a\\\\n\\\\nfunctional climbing tail.[131][134] The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. [135] Before nesting, the females of most bird\\\\n\\\\nspecies gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation. [136]\\\\n\\\\nFeathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily,\\\\n\\\\nspending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this. [137] The bill\\\\n\\\\nis used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from\\\\n\\\\nthe uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers\\\\\\' flexibility and act\\\\n\\\\nas an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading\\\\n\\\\nbacteria. [138] This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid\\\\n\\\\nfrom ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to\\\\n\\\\nremove feather parasites. [139]\\\\n\\\\nThe scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and\\\\n\\\\nspurs. They are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found\\\\n\\\\nRed lory preening\\\\n\\\\nfurther up on the ankle in some birds. Most bird scales do not overlap\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsignificantly, except in the cases of kingfishers and woodpeckers. The scales of birds are thought to be\\\\n\\\\nhomologous to those of reptiles and mammals. [140]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlight\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMost birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other\\\\n\\\\nvertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for\\\\n\\\\nmost bird species and is used for searching for food and for\\\\n\\\\nescaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight,\\\\n\\\\nincluding a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the\\\\n\\\\npectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird)\\\\n\\\\nand the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing)\\\\n\\\\nRestless flycatcher in the\\\\n\\\\nthat serves as an aerofoil.[77]\\\\n\\\\ndownstroke of flapping flight\\\\n\\\\nWing shape and size generally determine a bird\\\\\\'s flight style and\\\\n\\\\nperformance; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with\\\\n\\\\nless energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. [141] Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, most likely due to limited resources and\\\\n\\\\nthe absence of mammalian land predators. [142] Flightlessness is almost exclusively correlated with\\\\n\\\\ngigantism due to an island\\\\\\'s inherent condition of isolation. [143] Although flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \"fly\" through the water, as do some flight-capable birds such as auks,\\\\n\\\\nshearwaters and dippers. [144]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBehaviour\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMost birds are diurnal, but some birds, such as many species of owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or\\\\n\\\\ncrepuscular (active during twilight hours), and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.[145]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiet and feeding\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds\\\\\\' diets are varied and often include nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, carrion, and various small animals, including other birds.[77] The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. [146] Some species such as\\\\n\\\\npigeons and some psittacine species do not have a gallbladder. [147] Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. [148] Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein stored in many parts of\\\\n\\\\ntheir bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration. [149]\\\\n\\\\nBirds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists,\\\\n\\\\nwhile others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food\\\\n\\\\nare considered specialists. [77] Avian foraging strategies can vary widely by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species\\\\n\\\\nthat seek pest insects are considered beneficial \\\\\\'biological control agents\\\\\\' and their presence encouraged in\\\\n\\\\nbiological pest control programmes. [150] Combined, insectivorous birds eat 400–500 million metric tons of arthropods annually.[151]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets\\\\n\\\\namongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases\\\\n\\\\nbills designed to fit co-adapted flowers.[152] Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds\\\\\\' varied bill lengths and feeding\\\\n\\\\nmethods result in the separation of ecological niches. [77][153] Loons, diving\\\\n\\\\nducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, [68] while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers\\\\n\\\\nand terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. [154][155] Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.[156][157]\\\\n\\\\nSome species, including frigatebirds, gulls,[158] and skuas,[159] engage in\\\\n\\\\nkleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism is\\\\n\\\\nthought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a\\\\n\\\\nsignificant part of any species\\\\\\' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of\\\\n\\\\ntheir food and on average stole only 5%.[160] Other birds are scavengers;\\\\n\\\\nsome of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like\\\\n\\\\ngulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.[161]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWater and drinking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWater is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of\\\\n\\\\nsweat glands reduces the physiological demands. [162] Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. Some have\\\\n\\\\nFeeding adaptations in\\\\n\\\\nother adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on\\\\n\\\\nbeaks\\\\n\\\\nmoisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting.[163] Seabirds can drink\\\\n\\\\nseawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out\\\\n\\\\nof the nostrils.[164]\\\\n\\\\nMost birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. Some species,\\\\n\\\\nespecially of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. [165] Some desert birds depend on\\\\n\\\\nwater sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for congregating daily at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. [166] Some birds\\\\n\\\\ncarry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family,\\\\n\\\\nflamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks. [167]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFeather care\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFeathers, being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. Apart from physical wear and tear,\\\\n\\\\nfeathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and bird lice. [168] The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make\\\\n\\\\naerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid\\\\n\\\\nregions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many\\\\n\\\\nspecies will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in\\\\n\\\\nreducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage. [169][170]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMigration\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMany bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences\\\\n\\\\nof seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food\\\\n\\\\nsources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the\\\\n\\\\ndifferent groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds\\\\n\\\\nundertake annual long-distance migrations, usually triggered by the\\\\n\\\\nlength of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are\\\\n\\\\ncharacterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar\\\\n\\\\nregions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or A flock of Canada geese in V\\\\n\\\\nopposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase\\\\n\\\\nformation\\\\n\\\\nbody fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their\\\\n\\\\norgans.[171][172]\\\\n\\\\nMigration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without\\\\n\\\\nrefuelling. Landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) and shorebirds can fly up to\\\\n\\\\n4,000 km (2,500 mi), [77] although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi).[173] Some Seabirds undertake long migrations, with the longest annual migrations including those of Arctic terns, which were recorded travelling an average of 70,900 km (44,100 mi) between their\\\\n\\\\nArctic breeding grounds in Greenland and Iceland and their wintering grounds in Antarctica, with one bird covering 81,600 km (50,700 mi), [174] and sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and make annual round trips of 64,000 km (39,800 mi) to their summer feeding grounds in the North Pacific off\\\\n\\\\nJapan, Alaska and California.[175] Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.[176]\\\\n\\\\nSome bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as\\\\n\\\\nfar as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. Irruptive\\\\n\\\\nspecies such as the boreal finches are one such group and can\\\\n\\\\ncommonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next.\\\\n\\\\nThis type of migration is normally associated with food\\\\n\\\\navailability. [177] Species may also travel shorter distances over part\\\\n\\\\nof their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into\\\\n\\\\nthe existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial\\\\n\\\\nmigrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females\\\\n\\\\nand subdominant males, migrates. [178] Partial migration can form a\\\\n\\\\nlarge percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some\\\\n\\\\nThe routes of satellite-tagged bar-\\\\n\\\\nregions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds\\\\n\\\\ntailed godwits migrating north from\\\\n\\\\nand 32% of passerines were partially migratory.[179]\\\\n\\\\nNew Zealand. This species has the\\\\n\\\\nlongest known non-stop migration of\\\\n\\\\nAltitudinal migration is a form of short-distance migration in which\\\\n\\\\nany species, up to 10,200 km\\\\n\\\\n(6,300 mi).\\\\n\\\\nbirds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to\\\\n\\\\nlower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nby temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food.[180] Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to\\\\n\\\\nweather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations. [181]\\\\n\\\\nThe ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an\\\\n\\\\nexperiment conducted in the 1950s, a Manx shearwater released in Boston in the United States returned to its colony in Skomer, in Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi).[182] Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun\\\\n\\\\nduring the day by the use of an internal clock. [77] Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. [183] These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth\\\\\\'s geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.

See media help.\\\\n\\\\nBirds communicate primarily using visual and auditory signals. Signals can be interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species).\\\\n\\\\nBirds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance,[185] to display breeding condition in\\\\n\\\\nsexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern\\\\\\' s mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks.[186]\\\\n\\\\nVisual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-\\\\n\\\\nsignalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These\\\\n\\\\ndisplays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. [77] The\\\\n\\\\nmost elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \"dances\" are often formed from complex\\\\n\\\\ncombinations of many possible component movements;[187] males\\\\\\' breeding success may depend on the\\\\n\\\\nquality of such displays.[188]\\\\n\\\\nBird calls and songs, which are produced in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.[105] Calls are used for a variety\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nof purposes, including mate attraction,[77] evaluation of potential\\\\n\\\\nmates, [189] bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of\\\\n\\\\nterritories,[77][190] the identification of other individuals (such as\\\\n\\\\nwhen parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at\\\\n\\\\nthe start of breeding season), [191] and the warning of other birds of\\\\n\\\\npotential predators, sometimes with specific information about the\\\\n\\\\nnature of the threat.[192] Some birds also use mechanical sounds for\\\\n\\\\nauditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New\\\\n\\\\nThe startling display of the sunbittern\\\\n\\\\nZealand drive air through their feathers, [193] woodpeckers drum for mimics a large predator.\\\\n\\\\nlong-distance communication,[194] and palm cockatoos use tools to\\\\n\\\\ndrum.[195]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlocking and other associations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhile some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family\\\\n\\\\ngroups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of\\\\n\\\\nflocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. [77]\\\\n\\\\nDefence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats\\\\n\\\\nlike forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes\\\\n\\\\ncan provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the\\\\n\\\\ndevelopment of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are\\\\n\\\\nusually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks\\\\n\\\\nprovide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for\\\\n\\\\nRed-billed queleas, the most\\\\n\\\\nresources.[197] Costs of flocking include bullying of socially\\\\n\\\\nnumerous species of wild bird,[196]\\\\n\\\\nsubordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of\\\\n\\\\nform enormous flocks – sometimes\\\\n\\\\ntens of thousands strong.\\\\n\\\\nfeeding efficiency in certain cases. [198] Some species have a mixed\\\\n\\\\nsystem with breeding pairs maintaining territories, while unmated or\\\\n\\\\nyoung birds live in flocks where they secure mates prior to finding\\\\n\\\\nterritories.[199]\\\\n\\\\nBirds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species. Plunge-diving seabirds associate with\\\\n\\\\ndolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish towards the surface. [200] Some species of hornbills have a\\\\n\\\\nmutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.[201]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nResting and roosting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times.\\\\n\\\\nSleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening \"peeks\", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from\\\\n\\\\nthreats. [202] Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight.[203] It has been suggested that there may be certain\\\\n\\\\nkinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight. [204]\\\\n\\\\nSome birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock.\\\\n\\\\nThis may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nouter margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from\\\\n\\\\nmarine mammals.[205] Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with\\\\n\\\\npredators.[206] Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to\\\\n\\\\nthermoregulation and safety. [207] Unusual mobile roost sites include\\\\n\\\\nlarge herbivores on the African savanna that are used by\\\\n\\\\noxpeckers. [208]\\\\n\\\\nMany sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck\\\\n\\\\nMany birds, like this American\\\\n\\\\ntheir bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks\\\\n\\\\nflamingo, tuck their head into their\\\\n\\\\namong their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some\\\\n\\\\nback when sleeping.\\\\n\\\\nmay pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather.\\\\n\\\\nPerching birds have a tendon-locking mechanism that helps them\\\\n\\\\nhold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.\\\\n\\\\nA few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down.[209] Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. [210] This physiological\\\\n\\\\nadaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and\\\\n\\\\nwoodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. [211] Birds do not have sweat glands, but can lose water directly through the skin, and they may cool themselves by moving to\\\\n\\\\nshade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or using special\\\\n\\\\nbehaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.[212][213]\\\\n\\\\nBreeding\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSocial systems\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNinety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous.\\\\n\\\\nThese species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—\\\\n\\\\nin some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. [215]\\\\n\\\\nMonogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which care from both the\\\\n\\\\nfemale and the male parent is required in order to successfully rear a\\\\n\\\\nbrood.[216] Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair\\\\n\\\\ncopulation (infidelity) is common. [217] Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with\\\\n\\\\nsubordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in\\\\n\\\\nducks and other anatids. [218]\\\\n\\\\nFor females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include\\\\n\\\\ngetting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the\\\\n\\\\npossibility of infertility in her mate. [219] Males of species that\\\\n\\\\nLike others of its family, the male\\\\n\\\\nengage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to\\\\n\\\\nRaggiana bird-of-paradise has\\\\n\\\\nensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise. [220]\\\\n\\\\nelaborate breeding plumage used to\\\\n\\\\nimpress females. [214]\\\\n\\\\nOther mating systems, including polygyny, polyandry, polygamy,\\\\n\\\\npolygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur. [77] Polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males. [77] Mating systems\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nvary across bird families[221] but variations within species are thought to be driven by environmental\\\\n\\\\nconditions. [222] A unique system is the formation of trios where a third individual is allowed by a breeding\\\\n\\\\npair temporarily into the territory to assist with brood raising thereby leading to higher fitness. [223][190]\\\\n\\\\nBreeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male. [224] Most\\\\n\\\\ndisplays are rather simple and involve some type of song. Some displays, however, are quite elaborate.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal\\\\n\\\\nlekking. Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection,[225] although in the polyandrous\\\\n\\\\nphalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females. [226] Courtship feeding, billing\\\\n\\\\nand allopreening are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated. [227]\\\\n\\\\nHomosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds, including copulation, pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks. [228] Over 130 avian species around the world\\\\n\\\\nengage in sexual interactions between the same sex or homosexual behaviours. \"Same-sex courtship\\\\n\\\\nactivities may involve elaborate displays, synchronised dances, gift-giving ceremonies, or behaviours at\\\\n\\\\nspecific display areas including bowers, arenas, or leks.\" [229]\\\\n\\\\nTerritories, nesting and incubation\\\\n\\\\nMany birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season;\\\\n\\\\nmaintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding\\\\n\\\\nterritories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species\\\\n\\\\nfor nesting sites can be intense. [230]\\\\n\\\\nAll birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. [77] Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite\\\\\\'s egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.[231]\\\\n\\\\nBird eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create somewhat\\\\n\\\\nelaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, mounds, or\\\\n\\\\nburrows. [232] Some bird nests can be a simple scrape, with minimal\\\\n\\\\nor no lining; most seabird and wader nests are no more than a\\\\n\\\\nscrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden\\\\n\\\\nareas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are\\\\n\\\\nmore capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest\\\\n\\\\nconstruction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with\\\\n\\\\nMale golden-backed weavers\\\\n\\\\nparasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, [233] and feathers\\\\n\\\\nconstruct elaborate suspended nests\\\\n\\\\nout of grass.\\\\n\\\\nare often used for nest insulation. [232] Some bird species have no\\\\n\\\\nnests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock,\\\\n\\\\nand male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet.\\\\n\\\\nThe absence of nests is especially prevalent in open habitat ground-nesting species where any addition of\\\\n\\\\nnest material would make the nest more conspicuous. Many ground nesting birds lay a clutch of eggs that\\\\n\\\\nhatch synchronously, with precocial chicks led away from the nests (nidifugous) by their parents soon after hatching. [234]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIncubation, which regulates temperature for chick development,\\\\n\\\\nusually begins after the last egg has been laid. [77] In monogamous\\\\n\\\\nspecies incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous\\\\n\\\\nspecies one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth\\\\n\\\\nfrom parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare\\\\n\\\\nskin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation\\\\n\\\\ncan be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for\\\\n\\\\ninstance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day\\\\n\\\\nof incubation. [235] The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of\\\\n\\\\nNest of an eastern phoebe that has\\\\n\\\\nmegapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic\\\\n\\\\nbeen parasitised by a brown-headed\\\\n\\\\nsources. [236] Incubation periods range from 10 days (in\\\\n\\\\ncowbird\\\\n\\\\nwoodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).[77]\\\\n\\\\nThe diversity of characteristics of birds is great, sometimes even in closely related species. Several avian\\\\n\\\\ncharacteristics are compared in the table below.[237][238]\\\\n\\\\nSpecies\\\\n\\\\nAdult weight\\\\n\\\\nIncubation\\\\n\\\\nClutches\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClutch size\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(grams)\\\\n\\\\n(days)\\\\n\\\\n(per year)\\\\n\\\\nRuby-throated hummingbird ( Archilochus colubris)\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\n13\\\\n\\\\n2.0\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nHouse sparrow ( Passer domesticus)\\\\n\\\\n25\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\n4.5\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nGreater roadrunner ( Geococcyx californianus)\\\\n\\\\n376\\\\n\\\\n20\\\\n\\\\n1.5\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nTurkey vulture ( Cathartes aura)\\\\n\\\\n2,200\\\\n\\\\n39\\\\n\\\\n1.0\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nLaysan albatross ( Phoebastria immutabilis)\\\\n\\\\n3,150\\\\n\\\\n64\\\\n\\\\n1.0\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nMagellanic penguin ( Spheniscus magellanicus)\\\\n\\\\n4,000\\\\n\\\\n40\\\\n\\\\n1.0\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nGolden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos)\\\\n\\\\n4,800\\\\n\\\\n40\\\\n\\\\n1.0\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nWild turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo)\\\\n\\\\n6,050\\\\n\\\\n28\\\\n\\\\n1.0\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nParental care and fledging\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAt the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their\\\\n\\\\nspecies. Helpless chicks are termed altricial, and tend to be born small, blind, immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed precocial. Altricial chicks need help\\\\n\\\\nthermoregulating and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. The young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category, having some aspects of each and thus fall\\\\n\\\\nsomewhere on an \"altricial-precocial spectrum\". [239] Chicks at neither extreme but favouring one or the\\\\n\\\\nother may be termed semi-precocial[240] or semi-altricial. [241]\\\\n\\\\nThe length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme,\\\\n\\\\nparental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.[242] At the other extreme, many seabirds\\\\n\\\\nhave extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.[243] The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest\\\\n\\\\nafter chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and\\\\n\\\\nprotect them from predation. [244]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn some species, both\\\\n\\\\nparents care for nestlings\\\\n\\\\nand fledglings; in others,\\\\n\\\\nsuch\\\\n\\\\ncare\\\\n\\\\nis\\\\n\\\\nthe\\\\n\\\\nresponsibility of only one\\\\n\\\\nsex. In some species, other\\\\n\\\\nmembers of the same\\\\n\\\\nspecies—usually\\\\n\\\\nclose\\\\n\\\\nA female calliope hummingbird\\\\n\\\\nAltricial chicks of a white-breasted\\\\n\\\\nrelatives of the breeding\\\\n\\\\nfeeding fully grown chicks\\\\n\\\\nwoodswallow\\\\n\\\\npair, such as offspring from\\\\n\\\\nprevious broods—will help\\\\n\\\\nwith the raising of the young.[245] Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, [246] but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare.\\\\n\\\\nIn birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class. [77] Although territory\\\\n\\\\nand nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of\\\\n\\\\nlabour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty. [247]\\\\n\\\\nThe point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the\\\\n\\\\nancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. [248] Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from\\\\n\\\\nthe nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly.\\\\n\\\\nThe amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive\\\\n\\\\nno further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. [249] Chicks may\\\\n\\\\nalso follow their parents during their first migration. [250]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBrood parasites\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBrood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another\\\\n\\\\nindividual\\\\\\'s brood, is more common among birds than any other type of\\\\n\\\\norganism.[251] After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird\\\\\\'s nest, they\\\\n\\\\nare often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host\\\\\\'s own\\\\n\\\\nbrood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must\\\\n\\\\nlay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of\\\\n\\\\nraising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes\\\\n\\\\nlay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output\\\\n\\\\neven though they could have raised their own young. [252] One hundred\\\\n\\\\nbird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. [251] Some brood\\\\n\\\\nparasites are adapted to hatch before their host\\\\\\'s young, which allows them\\\\n\\\\nReed warbler raising a\\\\n\\\\nto destroy the host\\\\\\'s eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host\\\\\\'s\\\\n\\\\ncommon cuckoo, a brood\\\\n\\\\nchicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the\\\\n\\\\nparasite\\\\n\\\\nparasitic chicks. [253]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSexual selection\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds have evolved a variety of mating behaviours, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous\\\\n\\\\nexample of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway.\\\\n\\\\nCommonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size\\\\n\\\\nand colour differences are energetically costly\\\\n\\\\nattributes\\\\n\\\\nthat\\\\n\\\\nsignal\\\\n\\\\ncompetitive\\\\n\\\\nbreeding\\\\n\\\\nsituations.[254] Many types of avian sexual selection\\\\n\\\\nhave been identified; intersexual selection, also known\\\\n\\\\nas female choice; and intrasexual competition, where\\\\n\\\\nThe peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a\\\\n\\\\nindividuals of the more abundant sex compete with\\\\n\\\\nFisherian runaway\\\\n\\\\neach other for the privilege to mate. Sexually selected\\\\n\\\\ntraits often evolve to become more pronounced in\\\\n\\\\ncompetitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual\\\\\\'s fitness. Conflicts between an\\\\n\\\\nindividual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage\\\\n\\\\ncolouration and courtship behaviour are \"honest\" traits. Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviours. [255]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInbreeding depression\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInbreeding causes early death (inbreeding depression) in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. [256] Embryo survival (that is, hatching success of fertile eggs) was significantly lower for sib-sib mating pairs than for unrelated pairs.[257]\\\\n\\\\nDarwin\\\\\\'s finch Geospiza scandens experiences inbreeding depression (reduced survival of offspring) and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability.[258]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInbreeding avoidance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIncestuous matings by the purple-crowned fairy wren Malurus coronatus result in severe fitness costs due to\\\\n\\\\ninbreeding depression (greater than 30% reduction in hatchability of eggs). [259] Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings (see Promiscuity#Other animals for 90% frequency in avian species) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding. However, there are ecological and demographic\\\\n\\\\nconstraints on extra pair matings. Nevertheless, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females\\\\n\\\\ncontained extra pair young. [259]\\\\n\\\\nInbreeding depression occurs in the great tit ( Parus major) when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, inbreeding is\\\\n\\\\navoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close\\\\n\\\\nrelative. [260]\\\\n\\\\nSouthern pied babblers Turdoides bicolor appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways. The first is through dispersal, and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates.[261]\\\\n\\\\nCooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin. [262] Female offspring rarely stay at\\\\n\\\\nhome, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently, or to join unrelated groups. In\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ngeneral, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.[263] Cross-fertilisation between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny. [264][265]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEcology\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.[196] While some\\\\n\\\\nbirds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or\\\\n\\\\nfood requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the\\\\n\\\\nniches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some\\\\n\\\\nspecies feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and\\\\n\\\\nstill others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores,\\\\n\\\\nfrugivores, or nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Many grassland birds\\\\n\\\\nGran Canaria blue chaffinch, an\\\\n\\\\nare granivores. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or\\\\n\\\\nexample of a bird highly specialised\\\\n\\\\nother birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Birds are also\\\\n\\\\nin its habitat, in this case in the\\\\n\\\\npreyed upon by a range of mammals including a few avivorous\\\\n\\\\nCanarian pine forests\\\\n\\\\nbats. [266] A wide range of endo- and ectoparasites depend on birds\\\\n\\\\nand some parasites that are transmitted from parent to young have\\\\n\\\\nco-evolved and show host-specificity. [267]\\\\n\\\\nSome nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed\\\\n\\\\ndispersal. [268] Plants and pollinating birds often coevolve, [269] and in some cases a flower\\\\\\'s primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.[270]\\\\n\\\\nBirds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not;\\\\n\\\\non those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New\\\\n\\\\nZealand nine species of moa were important browsers, as are the kererū and kokako today.[268] Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa. [271]\\\\n\\\\nMany birds act as ecosystem engineers through the construction of nests, which provide important microhabitats and food for hundreds of species of invertebrates. [272][273] Nesting seabirds may affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano,\\\\n\\\\nwhich may enrich the local soil[274] and the surrounding seas. [275]\\\\n\\\\nA wide variety of avian ecology field methods, including counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking, are used for researching avian ecology.[276]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelationship with humans\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSince birds are highly visible and common animals, humans have had a relationship with them since the\\\\n\\\\ndawn of man.[277] Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana.[278] Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow[279] have benefited from human activities. Several species have reconciled to habits of farmers who practice traditional farming. Examples include the Sarus Crane that begins nesting in India when farmers flood the fields in anticipation of rains, [280] and the Woolly-necked\\\\n\\\\nStorks that have taken to nesting on a short tree grown for agroforestry beside fields and canals. [281]\\\\n\\\\nSeveral bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests,[282] and some pose an\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\naviation hazard.[283] Human activities can also be detrimental, and\\\\n\\\\nhave threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting,\\\\n\\\\navian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills[284]\\\\n\\\\nand predation by pet cats and dogs are common causes of death for birds).[285]\\\\n\\\\nBirds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis,\\\\n\\\\nsalmonellosis,\\\\n\\\\ncampylobacteriosis,\\\\n\\\\nmycobacteriosis\\\\n\\\\n(avian\\\\n\\\\ntuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and\\\\n\\\\nIndustrial farming of chickens\\\\n\\\\ncryptosporidiosis over long distances. Some of these are zoonotic\\\\n\\\\ndiseases that can also be transmitted to humans. [286]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEconomic importance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDomesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called poultry, are the largest\\\\n\\\\nsource of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, 76 million tons of\\\\n\\\\npoultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide. [287]\\\\n\\\\nChickens account for much of human poultry consumption, though\\\\n\\\\ndomesticated turkeys, ducks, and geese are also relatively common. [288]\\\\n\\\\nMany species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a\\\\n\\\\nrecreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most\\\\n\\\\nimportant birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other\\\\n\\\\nwidely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge,\\\\n\\\\ngrouse, snipe, and woodcock. Muttonbirding is also popular in Australia and New Zealand. [289] Although some hunting, such as that of\\\\n\\\\nmuttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or\\\\n\\\\nThe use of cormorants by\\\\n\\\\nendangerment of dozens of species.[290]\\\\n\\\\nAsian fishermen is in steep\\\\n\\\\ndecline but survives in some\\\\n\\\\nOther commercially valuable products from birds include feathers\\\\n\\\\nareas as a tourist attraction.\\\\n\\\\n(especially the down of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in\\\\n\\\\nclothing and bedding, and seabird faeces (guano), which is a valuable\\\\n\\\\nsource of phosphorus and nitrogen. The War of the Pacific, sometimes\\\\n\\\\ncalled the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.[291]\\\\n\\\\nBirds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as\\\\n\\\\nparrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species. [292] Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing,\\\\n\\\\nrespectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II.\\\\n\\\\nToday, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism,[293]\\\\n\\\\nAmateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) number in the millions.[294] Many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species. Bird feeding\\\\n\\\\nhas grown into a multimillion-dollar industry; for example, an estimated 75% of households in Britain\\\\n\\\\nprovide food for birds at some point during the winter. [295]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn religion and mythology\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology. In\\\\n\\\\nreligion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a\\\\n\\\\ndeity, such as in the Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of\\\\n\\\\nEaster Island served as chiefs[296] or as attendants, as in the case of Hugin\\\\n\\\\nand Munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin. In several civilisations of ancient Italy, particularly\\\\n\\\\nEtruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the \"auspex\" (from which the word\\\\n\\\\n\"auspicious\" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events. [297]\\\\n\\\\nThey may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: הנוי,\\\\n\\\\ndove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally\\\\n\\\\nassociated with doves. [298] Birds have themselves been deified, as in the\\\\n\\\\ncase of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the\\\\n\\\\nThe 3 of Birds by the Master\\\\n\\\\nof the Playing Cards, 15th-\\\\n\\\\npeople of southern India. [299] In the ancient world, doves were used as\\\\n\\\\ncentury Germany\\\\n\\\\nsymbols of the Mesopotamian goddess Inanna (later known as Ishtar), [300][301] the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, [300][301][302] and the Greek goddess Aphrodite. [300][301][303][304][305] In ancient Greece, Athena, the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of Athens, had a little owl as her symbol. [306][307][308] In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing\\\\n\\\\nboundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms.[309] Indigenous peoples of the central Andes\\\\n\\\\nmaintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.[309]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn culture and folklore\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBirds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when\\\\n\\\\nthey were represented in early cave painting[310] and carvings. [311]\\\\n\\\\nSome birds have been perceived as monsters, including the\\\\n\\\\nmythological Roc and the Māori\\\\\\'s legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. [312] Birds were later used as symbols\\\\n\\\\nof power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Painted tiles with design of birds\\\\n\\\\nPersian emperors. [313] With the advent of scientific interest in birds, from Qajar dynasty\\\\n\\\\nmany paintings of birds were commissioned for books.[314][315]\\\\n\\\\nAmong the most famous of these bird artists was John James\\\\n\\\\nAudubon, whose paintings of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society. [316] Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2.[317] The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of\\\\n\\\\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge\\\\\\'s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led to the use of the term as a metaphor\\\\n\\\\nfor a \\\\\\'burden\\\\\\' .[318] Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture. [319] Aircraft, particularly military aircraft, are\\\\n\\\\nfrequently named after birds. The predatory nature of raptors make them popular choices for fighter aircraft\\\\n\\\\nsuch as the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Harrier Jump Jet, while the names of seabirds may be chosen for aircraft primarily used by naval forces such as the HU-16 Albatross and the V-22 Osprey. [320]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPerceptions of bird species vary across cultures. Owls are\\\\n\\\\nassociated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of\\\\n\\\\nAfrica, [321] but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. [322]\\\\n\\\\nHoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of\\\\n\\\\nEurope and harbingers of war in Scandinavia. [323] In heraldry,\\\\n\\\\nThe flag of Dominica prominently\\\\n\\\\nbirds, especially eagles, often appear in coats of arms[324] In features the Sisserou Parrot, its\\\\n\\\\nvexillology, birds are a popular choice on flags. Birds feature in the national bird.\\\\n\\\\nflag designs of 17 countries and numerous subnational entities and\\\\n\\\\nterritories.[325] Birds are used by nations to symbolise a country\\\\\\'s\\\\n\\\\nidentity and heritage, with 91 countries officially recognising a national bird. Birds of prey are highly represented, though some nations have chosen other species of birds with parrots being popular among\\\\n\\\\nsmaller, tropical nations.[326]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn music\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn music, birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi, Messiaen, and Beethoven\\\\n\\\\ndid, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as Ottorino\\\\n\\\\nRespighi first did; or like Beatrice Harrison and David Rothenberg, they can duet with birds. [327][328][329][330]\\\\n\\\\nA 2023 archaeological excavation of a 10000-year-old site in Israel yielded hollow wing bones of coots and\\\\n\\\\nducks with perforations made on the side that are thought to have allowed them to be used as flutes or\\\\n\\\\nwhistles possibly used by Natufian people to lure birds of prey. [331]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThreats and conservation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHuman activities have caused population decreases or extinction in many\\\\n\\\\nbird species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical\\\\n\\\\ntimes, [332] although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions,\\\\n\\\\neradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human\\\\n\\\\ncolonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands. [333]\\\\n\\\\nMany bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed\\\\n\\\\nas threatened by BirdLife International and the IUCN in 2009. [334][335]\\\\n\\\\nThere have been long term declines in North American bird populations,\\\\n\\\\nwith an estimated loss of 2.9 billion breeding adults, about 30% of the total,\\\\n\\\\nsince 1970.[336][337]\\\\n\\\\nThe most commonly cited human threat to birds is habitat loss. [338] Other The California condor once\\\\n\\\\nnumbered only 22 birds, but\\\\n\\\\nthreats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to collisions with\\\\n\\\\nconservation measures\\\\n\\\\nbuildings or vehicles, long-line fishing bycatch,[339] pollution (including oil\\\\n\\\\nhave raised that to over 500\\\\n\\\\nspills and pesticide use), [340] competition and predation from nonnative today.\\\\n\\\\ninvasive species, [341] and climate change.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGovernments and conservation groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and\\\\n\\\\nrestore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise\\\\n\\\\nhave gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the California condor and Norfolk parakeet. [342]\\\\n\\\\nHuman activities have allowed the expansion of a few temperate area species, such as the barn swallow and\\\\n\\\\nEuropean starling. In the tropics and sub-tropics, relatively more species are expanding due to human activities, particularly due to the spread of crops such as rice whose expansion in south Asia has benefitted\\\\n\\\\nat least 64 bird species, though may have harmed many more species.
